# Online Insurance Management System


ONLINE INSURANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:-
In our daily lives we encounter lots of risks 
which result in fiscal losses. One of the 
excellent ways to safeguard these losses is 
through insurance. Insurance is basically a 
commercial means for relocating risks and 
covering fiscal losses. The insurance 
management system is a complete solution for 
organizations which need to manage insurance 
for their vehicles, equipment, buildings, and 
many other resources. It aims at organizing and 
tracking insurance vendors and the policies 
provided under different coverage.
It is known to us that the insurance 
companies need to keep track of details of 
their target companies, agents, policy holders, 
their premium payments and the various products 
that are available with them; making them 
prone to error and under tremendous pressure 
in maintaining their day-to-day activities. 
Thus, usage of paper in the payment process 
leads to less efficiency, less accuracy and 
less productivity which in turn enlightens the 
requirement of a more effective management 
system of insurance service. In the online 
insurance management system, if the user enters 
into the website, it will show the detail about 
insurance and other schemes of the policy 
through this online registration form thereby 
helping the customer to view their own 
insurance status. The system allows to see 
the logical elements from the physical 
components that it uses (computer, terminals 
and storage system).
